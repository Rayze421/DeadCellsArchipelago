"""
Dead Cells - Archipelago World
rules.py

Location-level access rules that go beyond region entrance conditions.
These are applied after create_regions() in __init__.py via set_rules().

Rule categories:
  - BSC level requirements (based on ProgBossRune count)
  - Item requirements (runes, AP items in inventory)
  - Boss kill requirements (specific location checks completed)
  - Skin count requirements (number of Skin-category items received)
  - Biome exit requirements (one of several biome_exit checks reached)
  - Combined conditions (AND / OR)

Adding new rules:
  Append entries to LOCATION_RULES below. Each entry is a dict:
    {
        "location": "ExactLocationName",   # from LOCATION_TABLE
        "requires": { ... }                # see RuleType constants below
    }
  Then re-run set_rules() — no other file needs changing.
